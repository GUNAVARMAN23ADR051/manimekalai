<h4>The Leaning Tower of Pisa</h4>
<P>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is the bell tower of Pisa Cathedral in Pisa , Italy . Although it was built to stand upright, the color is said to have started on August 9 , 1173 when construction began.

The height of the tower from the ground is 55 meters . Its mass is estimated to be 14,453 tons . Its current decline is around 10%. It has 297 steps.

On February 27 , 1964 , the Italian government made a request to help save the leaning tower from collapsing .

On January 7 , 1990 , the tower was closed to the public for security reasons.

Recently some construction work has been done to reduce the angle of inclination of the tower. After 10 years of work, it was reopened to the public on June 16 , 2001.</P>
